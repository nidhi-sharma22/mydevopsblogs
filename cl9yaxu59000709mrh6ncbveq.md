**Amazon Web Services** provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.

So Let's first understand what is **Cloud Computing** ?
And connect the points

**Cloud Computing** is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

I hope you are getting some points already cleared here.

Now What is **pay as you go basis**?

- It is a payment method for cloud computing that charges based on usage.

- You will pay only what you will use.


Now Let's read the definition once again by connecting the points.

AWS provides the **on demand delivery of computing services** like including servers, storage, databases etc. And the basic and important thing here is **you will only pay for what you will use.**

Example:- If You have created an EC2 instance in the cloud(We demanded EC2 and we got it in minutes), You have used it for a while and you terminated it.(AWS will charge only for what you have used) 

From here we can consider few important points about AWS 

- On demand Service
- Pay As you go Pricing
- You can access to as many resources you need instantly
- Simple way to access to servers, storage
