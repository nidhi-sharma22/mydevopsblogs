If you are from a non-technical background, And still want to know what is databases, Please don't worry guys, I will make you understand what are databases with **Images** and will see what all database services are provided by AWS.

Let's begin...

What are **DATABASES**?

*A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.*

Here we learned about EBS, want to read detailed blog--&gt; visit [https://nidhidevops.hashnode.dev/elastic-block-storage-amazon-machine-image](https://nidhidevops.hashnode.dev/elastic-block-storage-amazon-machine-image)

Also learned about S3 üëáüëá

[https://nidhidevops.hashnode.dev/amazon-simple-storage-service-amazon-s3](https://nidhidevops.hashnode.dev/amazon-simple-storage-service-amazon-s3)

Above mentioned articles are for Storage only, So why there is a need for Databases???

The answer is Because S3, EBS and EC2 instance stores can have limits. Apart from this one wants structured data or define relations. You can use Databasesüòçüòç Easy right?

## Relational databases

As the name suggests, The work is also in the same way üëå

A relational database is ***a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another***.

More simply, The different tables are connected with a common point.

See the image üëâüëâüëáüëá

Now let's move to the next one

### **NoSQL Databases**

NoSQL--&gt; no SQL--&gt; no relation

NoSQL has flexible Schemas and they are purpose-built for modern applications

For NoSQL, you can use JSON Schemas

Guys, Get ready to learn Amazon RDS. üëáüôå

## Amazon Relational Database

* It's a managed DB service and uses SQL as a query language
    
* ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1678901875513/51b6016f-5ccd-47bc-9d05-e3bd9d019c67.png align="center")
    

Above image displays how Amazon RDS works üëÜüëÜ

* In the above image, 7 RDS engines are ¬†[Amazon Aurora with MySQL compatibility](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/?pg=ln&sec=hiw), [Amazon Aurora with PostgreSQL compatibility](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/?pg=ln&sec=hiw),¬†[MySQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mysql/?pg=ln&sec=hiw), [MariaDB](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mariadb/?pg=ln&sec=hiw), [PostgreSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/?pg=ln&sec=hiw),¬†[Oracle](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/oracle/?pg=ln&sec=hiw), and [SQL Server](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/sqlserver/?pg=ln&sec=hiw). Other steps are self-understood.
    
* This means that the code, applications, and tools you already use today with your existing databases should work seamlessly with Amazon RDS.
    
* With RDS, you don't need to worry about the underlying infrastructure, such as hardware provisioning, software patching, or database backups. Instead, AWS takes care of all of that for you, so you can focus on building your applications.
    

Hope you understood Amazon RDS

Let's move to the next one

## AMAZON Aurora

* [Amazon Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/) is a modern [relational database](https://aws.amazon.com/relational-database/) service.
    
* Unlike AWS RDS it is only MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible.
    
* It provides built-in security, continuous backups, and serverless computing.
    
* And up to 15 read replicas, automated multi-Region replication, and integrations with other AWS services.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1678903821980/ddf890ae-87b4-4089-b00f-4a6c999b08b9.png align="center")

Above image makes AA(Amazon Aurora üòÅ) easy to understand.

Guys Theory is not at all enough in AWS you have to go through the practical sessions as well.(Knowlege is good but implemention of that knowledge is way more important)

So Now we will look through RDS practically

Let's get started guys, Excitedüòç

    Go to the newly created snapshot, and see if the status is available.
    
* Under Actions, if you click restore the snapshot, it will help you to create a new database, a bigger database, or a copy of the database(Isn't this amazingüòÅ)
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1678990169889/9b797d1f-fdc1-41bc-a324-e01766c02eb7.png align="center")

Let's move to the next Amazing thing, Read this carefullyüëáüëá

## Amazon ElastiCache

Yes, Guys Let's see what's amazing in thisü§î

What is Cache?

A cache is a hardware or software component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster; the data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation or a copy of data stored elsewhere.

Now Read the below about the ElasticCache, everything will get clear

* Amazon ElastiCache is¬†a fully managed, Redis- and Memcached-compatible service.
    
* That means it's a caching service built to deliver real-time performance for real-time applications.
    
* ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1679160719128/ef8993f4-d39e-4783-a703-6d5a976bb4c1.png align="center")
    
    It reduces the load from databases for intensive workloads.
    

Guys Let's meet with the database which is very heavy when we say its name. It is üëá

(Just Kidding)

## DynamoDB

* DynamoDB is a fast and flexible <mark>nonrelational database(NoSQL) service</mark> for any scale.
    
* Its flexible data model and reliable performance make DynamoDB a great fit for mobile, web, gaming, advertising technology, Internet of Things, and other applications.
    
* <mark>Single-digit millisecond latency</mark>
    
* DynamoDB offers built-in security, continuous backups, automated multi-Region replication, in-memory caching, and data import and export tools.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1680019158892/3b8f17cc-7bcf-46ee-86a2-06f31819cdf3.png align="center")

Let's read the Use cases which will make us Understand this better

**Applications with large amounts of data and strict latency requirements**. As your amount of data scales, JOINs and advanced SQL operations can slow down your queries. With DynamoDB, your queries have predictable latency up to any size, including over 100 TBs!

**Serverless applications using AWS Lambda**. [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) provides auto-scaling, stateless, ephemeral compute in response to event triggers. DynamoDB is accessible via an HTTP API and performs authentication & authorization via IAM roles, making it a perfect fit for building Serverless applications.

**Data sets with simple, known access patterns**. If you're generating recommendations and serving them to users, DynamoDB's simple key-value access patterns make it a fast, reliable choice.

Above we have learned about in-memory cache, right?

In the same way, we have a dedicated in-memory Cache for DyamoDB that is

### DynamoDB Accelerator - DAX

Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is a fully managed, highly available, in-memory cache for Amazon DynamoDB that delivers up to a 10 times performance improvement‚Äîfrom milliseconds to microseconds‚Äîeven at millions of requests per second.

DAX does all the heavy lifting required to add in-memory acceleration to your DynamoDB tables, without requiring developers to manage cache invalidation

**<mark>DAX is only used for DynamoDB</mark>**

Now Let's move to **Redshift** üëáüëáüëá

## AWS REDSHIFT

* An Amazon Redshift data warehouse is an enterprise-class relational database query and management system.
    
* Amazon Redshift achieves efficient storage and optimum query performance through a combination of massively parallel processing, columnar data storage, and very efficient, targeted data compression encoding schemes.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1680019113951/0a9fa10c-7352-4b1f-a5e3-1f7063086cd0.png align="center")

### Traditional databases VS REDSHIFT

Data Warehousing is the process of storing and analyzing data from multiple sources to provide meaningful business insights. It involves transforming the data from multiple sources into a common format for both storage and analysis. This process is generally known as **ETL** or **Extract, Load,** and **Transform**. Data Warehouses like Amazon Redshift leverage this process to cater to their customers.

Next is AMAZON EMRüòäüòä

## AMAZON EMR
