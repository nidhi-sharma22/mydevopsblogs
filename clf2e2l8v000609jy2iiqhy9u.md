Hi guys,

As we are a LinkedIn familyüòç There is also an AWS SNOW family.

Are you excited to meet our beautiful AWS snow family?

Let's get started

The **AWS Snow Family is a collection of physical devices** that help migrate large amounts of data into and out of the cloud without depending on networks.

Now Let's see what are all those Physical devices and learn about them.

## **AWS Snowcone**

It is the smallest member of the AWS Snow Family of edge computing and data transfer devices. Snowcone is portable, rugged, and secure. You can use Snowcone to collect, process, and move data to AWS, either offline by shipping the device, or online with AWS DataSync.

PS:- Read the Above Image carefully, You can understand snowcone very easily.

## AWS SNOWBALL

It is a suitcase-sized data migration and edge computing device that comes in two device options: Compute Optimized and Storage Optimized. Snowball Edge Storage Optimized devices provide 40 vCPUs of compute capacity coupled with 80 terabytes of usable block or Amazon S3-compatible object storage. It is well-suited for local storage and large-scale data transfer. Snowball Edge Compute Optimized devices provide 52 vCPUs, 42 terabytes of usable block or object storage, and an optional GPU for use cases such as advanced machine learning and full motion video analysis in disconnected environments.

PS:- Images are the best way of explanation to remember anything. ü•∞

Now Let's move to the biggest device you have read till now

## AWS SNOWMOBILE

AWS Snowmobile moves extremely large amounts of data to AWS. Transfer up to 100 PB per Snowmobile, a 45-foot-long ruggedized shipping container pulled by a semi-trailer truck.

Are you getting my point now, why I said it the biggest one üò•üò•

Yes Guys that is **SnowmobileüëÜüöõ**

Now You might get this Questionüëá

**Why do I need Snow Family services?**

It can take a long time to transfer large amounts of data over the wire, and some locations don't have any connectivity at all. The Snow Family helps expedite data transfers in a more secure and cost-effective way. Each service has a pre-set capacity level to make it easy to choose the right option for you. ***Snowcone and Snowball Edge further help bring computing applications closer to the data source to enhance analysis and deliver real-time results.***

### **Use cases**

* Data transfer and occasional pre-processing on location.
    
* Large data transfer examples include cloud migration and disaster recovery.
    
* For Snowcone and Snowball Edge computing capabilities include IoT sensor stream capture, on-the-fly media transcoding, image compression, aggregating metrics, and control signaling and alarming.
    

Isn't this amazingüòç?

Yes, It is, You use physical devices to transfer a large amount of data and it shows power of cloud in the disconnected enviornments.
